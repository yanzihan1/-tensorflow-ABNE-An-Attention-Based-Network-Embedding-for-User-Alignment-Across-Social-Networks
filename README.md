# (tensorflow)-ABNE-An-Attention-Based-Network-Embedding-for-User-Alignment-Across-Social-Networks

ABNE-An-Attention-Based-Network-Embedding-for-User-Alignment-Across-Social-Networks(IEEE 2019)，paper author uses Java(https://github.com/ColaLL/IONE) ,For wider application, we have updated the python version，use tensorflow1.14.0

Source Code and anonymous twitter_foursquare data for IJCAI 2016 paper "Aligning Users Across Social Networks Using Network Embedding" Feel free to contact athuor (Liu Li liuli0407@hotmail.com) when you have any problems about the paper or the code(Java 8).

Feel free to contact me (Zihan Yan yzhcqupt@163.com) when you have any problems about the code(Python tensorflow1.14.0)

#For the IONE, run the main.py.

#You should first run the main.py and second run the IONE_T.py to get the Twitter and Foursquare's embedding

T.edge mains twitter graph

F.edge mains fousquare graph

train file mains anchor set,You can change train ratio by changing the 'p',such as p=0.1 represents train ratio = 10%

If you want to use another social network, pls modify the parameter size of the network,Here is twitter(5120),foursquare(5313).
Experimental comparison：(We have done a number of experiments and take the average value such as train ratio10%, p@1-p@30)

#IONE(JAVA):0.0149,0.0534,0.0929,0.09548,0.129,0.158

#IONE(python):0.0131,0.0527,,0.0999,111,0.137,0.166

Accuracy in other experiments：-0.005 ~ +0.007
